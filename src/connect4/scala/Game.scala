/* ABOUT TESTING.
 * Testing is difficult using a JUnit testing class because it is difficult to
 * get at many of the fields and methods from that class. So you may want to
 * put some testing methods in this class.
 *
 * In testing various methods, you may want to use boards with certain
 * layouts of your choosing. For example, a board with column 0 all filled.
 * To do this, you can
 *
 *     1. Create a board b
 *     2. Call makeMove several times to put pieces where you want them.
 *     3. Play the game.
 *
 * For example, you can write the following to set up an initial board and
 * then play the game
connect4.java.Board
connect4.java.Board     Board b= new Board();
connect4.java.Move connect4.java.PlayerakeMove(new Move(Player.RED, 4));
connect4.java.Move connect4.java.PlayerakeMove(new Move(Player.YELLOW, 3));
connect4.java.Move connect4.java.PlayerakeMove(new Move(Player.REDconnect4.java.Game);
connect4.java.Game    Game game= new Game(p1, p2, b, false);
 *
 * This code places a red piece in column 4, a yellow piece in column 3,
 * and a red piece in column 5. Then it runs the game.
 *
 * We give you also procedure fillColumn at the end of this file to help
 * out in initializing a board. Study it. Note that it is static.
 *
 * Suppose you want to test a methodconnect4.java.Board your wrote, like Board.getPossibleMoves.
 * Thus, you want to do the following.
 *
 *     1. Create a board b
 *     2. Call makeMove several times to put pieces where you want them.
 *     3. Call the method you want to test.
 *     4. Check the result, if any.
 *
 * You can check the result by using println statements to print out things and
 * looking at the output. You are testing by eyeballing the output. This is OK as
 * long as you are careful. Here is how you could print out the results of a
 * call to getPossibleMoves:
connect4.java.Board
connect4.java.Board     Board b= new Board();
connect4.java.Player   fillColumn(b, Player.RED, 0);  // fill coconnect4.java.Move 0
 *      Move[] movconnect4.java.PlayergetPossibleMoves(Player.RED)connect4.java.Move       *      for (Move m : moves) {
 *           System.out.println(m);
 *
 * If you are having real trouble, the above may not help. Here is what you
 * can do to connect4.java.Board  very basics of Board.getPossibleMoves:
connect4.java.Board
connect4.java.Board     Board b= new Board();
connect4.java.Player   fillColumn(b, Player.RED, 0);  // fill connect4.java.Move 0
 *      Move[] movconnect4.java.Board.connect4.java.PlayersibleMoves(Board.Player.RED);
 *   connect4.java.Board (moves.length != Board.NUM_COLS-1) {
 *          System.out.println("Error in getPossibleMoves with 1 col filled. array size is wrong: " +  moves.length);
 *      }
 *      if (moves[0].getColumn() != 1) {
 *          System.out.println(s + "First col is filled, second isn't but moves[0] is " + moves[0]);
 *      }
 *
 * We suggest you write a static method to test getPossibleMoves
 * (and perhaps other methods for other tests).
 * Make it a method so that you can call it or not from method main, depending on
 * your needs. It doesn't have to test ALL possible cases, but it has to check
 * enough that so you are positive the method works.
 *
 *
